# [Left 2 Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3661616893)

> **“Kill all sons o’ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. That’s my ’ficial instructions.”**

Left 2 Mod is a custom Garry’s Mod gamemode that recreates the core Left 4 Dead experience, reimagined for sandbox flexibility, heavy modding, and expanded player counts.

This is not meant to replace the original game. Instead, it’s a faithful recreation designed to let creators push beyond Left 4 Dead’s built-in limits.

## What is Left 2 Mod?

Left 2 Mod recreates the cooperative zombie survival gameplay of Left 4 Dead inside Garry’s Mod, allowing you to combine classic mechanics with GMod’s massive modding ecosystem.

Expect familiar pacing, teamwork, and survival gameplay, with far fewer restrictions.

---

## Why use Left 2 Mod instead of Left 4 Dead?

Because you want more freedom.

Left 2 Mod enables things that simply aren’t possible in the original game:

* Larger player counts beyond the classic 4 survivors
* Custom weapons from any GMod base
* Custom player models
* Fully moddable campaigns and scenarios
* Mixing original L4D maps with custom content

It’s built for creators who want Left 4 Dead gameplay without Left 4 Dead limitations.

---

## Example Use Cases

* Create story-driven campaigns with themed custom weapons
* Add new weapons to classic Left 4 Dead maps
* Combine multiple custom campaigns into one experience
* Run large co-op sessions with unique survivor models

If you can build it in Garry’s Mod, you can probably run it here.
